# Userland Multilevel Feedback Queues (MLFQ)

Hooray! You get to reuse some code from the previous project. The
commands you must handle are repeated from the previous project.

In this project you will build a Multilevel Feedback Queue simulated
scheduler in userland. Your scheduler will read a data file
containing information simulating timer interrupts, job arrivals, job
terminations, etc. Your output will be graded against known good
results. Any deviation (even by a single space) may be counted as wrong,
so **follow the specification completely**.

You will be able to run tests against my grading script to debug any
textual differences.

## Requirements Embedded in the Specification

To encourage you to read this specification thoroughly, certain project
requirements are embedded inline in this document. Failure to
implement requires will result in points off.

## Partner rules

You may use a partner on this project.

One partner must turn in the code. This code must list the authors.
If you have no partner, then say so. If you have a partner, you must
identify them. Failure to do this will be points off.

The other partner must hand in only a text file stating who the
partners are. A text file is a text file. It is not a PDF, not a
Google Doc, not a web page, not a Word file and not a spreadsheet.
Failure to do this will be points off.

## Choice of Language

You may use C or C++. I encourage you to use C++ to take advantage of
[`deque`](https://cplusplus.com/reference/deque/deque/).

## Use of Precise Integer Types

Please use `int32_t` rather than `int`, etc. This is not a requirement
but I do encourage it.

## MLFQ in OSTEP

Refer to chapter 8 of OSTEP. Reminder (adapted for this project):

* Rule 1: If Priority(A) > Priority(B), A runs (B doesnâ€™t).

* Rule 2: If Priority(A) = Priority(B), A & B run in round-robin
fashion.

* Rule 3: When a job enters the system, it is placed at the highest
priority (the topmost queue).

* Rule 4: Once a job uses up its time allotment at a given level (regardless
of how many times it has given up the CPU), its priority is
reduced (i.e., it moves down one queue).

* Rule 5: After some time period S, move all the jobs in the system
to the topmost queue.

In the above, references to Priority equates to which queue a process
is on.

## Command Line Options

Your program will take just one argument - the name of the data file to
execute.

It is an error if the file is not given *or* cannot be opened for
reading. If this error occurs, you must emit an explanatory message
using `cerr`. The error message strings are:

* "Missing input file name." and

* Input file failed to open.

If these errors occur, your program must terminate with a return code
of 1.

## Platform

This project can be coded natively on the Mac, you don't need to use
a Linux VM.

This project must be coded under WSL on Windows or on a Linux machine.
Windows does not have `getopt()`. Why? Microsoft. The one written for PD
is cumbersome to install. So, straight Windows is off the menu.

## Input

Your program will take a data file as its command line argument. It
contains *comma separated value* lines with the following syntax:

| opcode | argument 1 | argument 2 | meaning |
| ------ | ---------- | ----------  | ------- |
| newjob | NAME | | A new job arrives with the given NAME **\*** |
| finish | | | The currently running job has terminated - it is an error if the system is idle |
| interrupt | | | A timer interrupt has occurred - the currently running job's quantum is over |
| block | | | The currently running job has become blocked |
| unblock | NAME | | The named job becomes unblocked - it is an error if it was not blocked |
| runnable | | | Print information about the jobs in the runnable queue |
| running | | | Print information about the currently running job |
| blocked | | | Print information about the jobs on the blocked queue |
| epoch | | | An Epoch has elapsed. Process as per MLFQ algorithm - this is not in your previous project |

**\*** Note that this project's "newjob" does not take a PRIORITY. This
is different from your previous project. It is assigned to the topmost
queue as per the MLFQ algorithm.

My test input is guaranteed to have correct syntax so you do not have to
check for errors.

Note that if you create your own tests (you should), you can add
comments by appending a comma plus your comments at the end of an
input line. Don't put commas in your comments. See
[this](./tests/test11.input.txt) for an example.

For example:

```text
newjob,A,A runs.
newjob,B
newjob,C
interrupt,A goes to 1. B runs.
```

Lines 1 and 4 have comments.

## NO MAGIC NUMBERS

You must not use any magic numbers. Any numeric literals should be
`const` variables with **good descriptive names**.

## The Queues

**PAY ATTENTION TO THIS!**

There shall be a total of 4 queues named 0 through 3.

Each queue is managed with Round Robin.

The quantum is 10ms. The milliseconds as units is, of
course, meaningless as this is a simulation.

The Epoch is defined as 1000ms.

Any deviation from this will result in points off.

## Operation

### newjob

A new job is entered into the system. Its name is given.
Assume all job names are unique. A new job's arrival does not cause a
rescheduling unless the system was idle.

```text
New job: C added.
```

### finish

The currently running job has completed and should be removed from the
system.

```text
Job: B completed.
```

If the system is idle, it is an error.

Note that errors of this kind are emitted to `cout` and not `cerr`.

```text
Error. System is idle.
```

### interrupt

The currently running task has completed its quantum. Adjust your
bookkeeping. The scheduler needs to run again.

```text
Job: C scheduled.
```

It is an error if `interrupt` is received when the system is idle.

```text
Error. System is idle.
```

### block

The currently running task has become blocked. Perhaps it is asking for
an I/O. The argument specifies the number of milliseconds to be added
to the task's quantum.

```text
Job: A blocked.
```

It is an error if the system is idle.

```text
Error. System is idle.
```

### unblock

The named job has become unblocked. Return it to the queue it
came from and reschedule.

```text
Job: A has unblocked.
```

It is an error if the named job was not blocked.

```text
Error. Job: C not blocked.
```

Unblocked jobs return to the runnables onto the queue on which they
were last found as per MLFQ. The scheduler is not run unless
the system was idle.

### runnable

The runnables, if any, are listed. Note this command's output
is quite different from the previous project. Example:

```text
Runnables:
NAME    QUEUE  
B       0       
A       0       
C       2
Z       3
G       3
T       3
```

These must be listed in the order they would be scheduled.

### running

The running task is described (if system is not idle). Example:

```text
Running:
NAME    QUEUE
H       0
```

### blocked

The blocked tasks are listed, if any. Example:

```text
Blocked:
NAME    QUEUE
I       0
K       2
J       2
```

### epoch

You will be told when an epoch has
expired when you receive an "epoch" command. Handle this as per
the MLFQ algorithm. Note that "epoch" does **not** cause a
rescheduling. That is, a process running when you receive an
"epoch" will remain running but will also be marked as coming
from the initial highest priority queue.

Here is a sample output from "epoch":

```text
Job: C lifted up.
Job: B lifted up.
Job: A lifted up.
```

"epoch" should produce a line for every process in the system.

## Picking the Next Task to Schedule

When a rescheduling is required, pick the next task to run according
to the MLFQ algorithm.

```text
Job: C scheduled.
```

## Running the tests

The results of the stride schedule are deterministic. Given the same
input, you will get the same output. Therefore, automatic testing is
possible.

I provide a `bash` script for testing purposes. The script takes two
command line options.

| option | required? | argument | purpose |
| ------ | --------- | -------- | ------- |
| a | no | progname | specifies name of your executable - defaults to ./a.out |
| i | yes | testroot | specifies the root name of the test to run |

The folder containing the test script is meant to contain the folder
`tests` where the test data is actually stored. So, if you specify `-i
test1`, the actual data file will resolve to `tests/test1.input.txt`.

Here is sample output from a test:

```text
```

Here is output from a more sophisticated test:

```text
```

You will be given only *some* of the tests I will use for grading. Some,
I hold in reserve to test corner cases, etc. If you pass all the tests
you are given, you have a reasonable change of a high score but this is
not a certainty.

Feel free to read the source code of the test script to see an example
of `bash` scripting.

## What to Turn In

This is *the second time* this requirement is being stated. I must
*really, really* mean it.

One partner must turn in the code. This code must list the authors.
If you have no partner, then say so. If you have a partner, you must
identify them. Failure to do this will be points off.

The other partner must hand in only a text file stating who the
partners are. A text file is a text file. It is not a PDF, not a
Google Doc, not a web page, not a Word file and not a spreadsheet.
Failure to do this will be points off.

## Setting Expectations

For the purpose of setting your expectations only, my solution is
295 lines long including comments, asserts, and some calls to
`cout` spread over several lines.

As usual, the specification is longer than the solution :(.

These are the includes from my solution, provided for your
interest purposes only. You don't have to follow this example:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <sstream>
#include <deque>
#include <vector>
# include <iomanip>
```

Remember: 

* no magic numbers.

* Constants should be `const`.

* No warnings! I will be compiling your code with:

```text
g++ -Wall --pedantic -g -std=c++11 your_code.cpp
```

You might want to do the same.
