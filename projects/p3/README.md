# CSC 4730 Fall 2023 Project 3

User land scheduler simulations: Stride and MLFQ

## Objectives

The educational purpose for this project master the scheduling
algorithms called Stride and MLFQ (Multi Level Feedback Queue).
You will accomplish this by reading the appropriate chapters in
OSTEP and writing two programs.

One program will read formatted data, feeding it into a stride
scheduler.

The other program will read formatted data, feeding it into an MLFQ
scheduler.

The format of the data is almost the same for the two programs. Writing that
portion in one program can be adapted for the other and both partners can
finish the pair of programs in parallel.

## Deadlines

You and your assigned partner have 7 days to complete this assignment
plus one grace day. If you have not turned anything in by 11:59 PM on
the eighth day, you will win a grade of zero. Therefore, to receive
partial credit, hand in something before the project expires!

## Overview

Each of these programs has its own specification:

* [Stride](./stride.md)

* [MLFQ](./mlfq.md)

The data each of these consume is very similar so the work you do on
parsing the input can be shared across both programs.

## What to Hand In

Zip your source code files together and submit that.

## Partners

* You must use only the partner I assign you.

* Only 1 person should hand in code. The code should clearly state who
  the partners are in a new text file `partner.txt` in the main
  directory.

* The non-code-submitting partner must submit a text file “partner.txt”
  that states who the partners are.

* Failure to list partners correctly as described above removes 5 points
  from your grade.

## Software Kills

You goofed when you tweaked the scheduler of the system running a
nuclear power plant. It starves a crucial monitoring task. The reactor
melts down. Millions die.

## Grading

The class will receive a rubric when grading is complete that describes
errors and penalties.

Both partners get the same grade without exception.
